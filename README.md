# X for Y generation.

## Description
This is a simple program which generates psuedo random startup ideas, based on a "The X for Y" format.  Our Twitter Bot can be found here: https://twitter.com/NextBigThingBot.

This bot is currently hosted on [Glitch](http://glitch.com).  We use [uptimerobot](https://uptimerobot.com/) to make an http request every 12 hours to the server where this is hosted.  Every time the server gets any ping it will tweet.

## Helping
If you would like to help you can :
- Add X's to X.txt.
- Add Y's to Y.txt.

These are pretty easy.  Just put your ideas on a new line in the file, commit, push, and send us the pull request. The only rule is 1 item per line. Obscene things may or may not be merged.

Some items are mentions more than once, like Uber.  This increases the likelihood that it is chosen. We do this only for a few items since they tend to work better more often.
